# Speech Recognition

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the use of the Web Speech API for text-to-speech and speech recognition functionality. Users can input text to be read aloud by the browser and can also use speech recognition to transcribe spoken words into text in real-time.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert text input into spoken words using the browser's speech synthesis capabilities.
- **Speech Recognition**: Real-time transcription of spoken words into text, displayed simultaneously in a text area.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Web Speech API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you need a modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

### Where Can It Be Used?

This project can be used in various applications, including but not limited to:

- **Accessibility Tools**: Enhance accessibility for users with visual impairments or other disabilities by providing text-to-speech capabilities.
- **Voice-Controlled Applications**: Implement voice commands and controls in web applications.
- **Language Learning**: Assist language learners by allowing them to practice pronunciation and listening comprehension.
- **Transcription Services**: Provide real-time transcription for meetings, lectures, or personal notes.
